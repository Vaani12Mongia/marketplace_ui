              <h3 style={{ fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 700, marginTop: 24, marginBottom: 12 }}>1.1. Licence Grant</h3>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
                Offerings are licensed, not sold. Upon subscription, and subject to Customer's compliance with this Agreement, Publisher grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited licence to access and use the Offering solely for Customer's own internal airline operations during the active Subscription term. The Offering may incorporate components subject to open-source software licences. Where such components are included, the applicable open-source licence terms are incorporated by reference and take precedence over this Section to the extent of any inconsistency.
              </p>

              <h3 style={{ fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 700, marginTop: 24, marginBottom: 12 }}>1.2. Subscription Term</h3>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
                The initial Subscription term is twelve (12) months from the Effective Date ("initial Subscription Year"). Subscriptions renew automatically for successive twelve (12) month periods ("Subscription Year") at Publisher's then-current list price for the Offering, unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least sixty (60) days before the end of the then-current Subscription Year. Publisher will give Customer at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice of any price change before it applies to a renewal. If Customer does not wish to renew at the new price, Customer may give notice of non-renewal before the new price takes effect and no further charges will apply after the end of the then-current Subscription Year. Subscription fees and billing cadence are as set out in the applicable Order.
              </p>

              <h3 style={{ fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 700, marginTop: 24, marginBottom: 12 }}>1.3. Authorised Users</h3>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
                Customer is responsible for controlling access to the Offering and for all use of the Offering by its Authorised Users. Customer must ensure that all Authorised Users comply with this Agreement. The Offering is intended for use by Customer's Operations Control Centre (OCC) personnel responsible for initiating and approving passenger notifications during disruption events. The maximum number of Authorised Users is as set out in the applicable Order. Customer must not permit access by more Authorised Users than are licensed under the applicable Order.
              </p>

              <h3 style={{ fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 700, marginTop: 24, marginBottom: 12 }}>1.4. Reservation of Rights</h3>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
                All rights in and to the Offering not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved by Publisher. The Offering is protected by copyright and other applicable intellectual property laws. No licence, right, or interest is granted by implication, waiver, or estoppel. Customer acquires no ownership interest in the Offering by virtue of this Agreement.

              <h3 style={{ fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 700, marginTop: 24, marginBottom: 12 }}>1.6. Non-Transferability</h3>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
                The Subscription and all rights granted under this Agreement are personal to Customer and may not be transferred or assigned without Publisher's prior written consent, except as part of a merger, acquisition, or transfer of substantially all of Customer's assets, in which case Section 12.4 applies.
              </p>

              <h3 style={{ fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 700, marginTop: 24, marginBottom: 12 }}>1.7. Feedback</h3>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
                Where Customer voluntarily provides Feedback to Publisher, Customer grants Publisher a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual licence to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and incorporate such Feedback into Publisher's products and services solely for product development and improvement purposes. Feedback that Customer designates as confidential in writing at the time of submission will be treated as Confidential Information and may not be disclosed to third parties or used in a manner that would identify Customer without Customer's prior written consent. Publisher's use of Feedback does not give rise to any claim of inventorship, co-ownership, or compensation by Customer.
              </p>

              <h3 style={{ fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 700, marginTop: 24, marginBottom: 12 }}>1.8. Customer Configuration and HITL Responsibility</h3>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>
                The Offering supports a Human-in-the-Loop ("HITL") workflow in which Customer's Authorised Users (OCC personnel) initiate and approve passenger notifications before they are dispatched. Customer must enable and maintain the HITL approval process for all passenger-facing communications. Customer must provide Publisher with at least five (5) Business Days' prior written notice before disabling or materially modifying the HITL workflow. Where Customer disables or bypasses the HITL workflow without such notice, Publisher's liability exclusion under Section 9.3 applies in full and Publisher's warranty under Section 7.1.3 is suspended in respect of any AI Outputs generated during that period.
              </p>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 12, fontWeight: 600 }}>Customer is solely responsible for:</p>
              <ul style={{ marginLeft: 32, marginBottom: 16, listStyleType: 'decimal' }}>
                <li style={{ marginBottom: 8 }}>ensuring that all required HITL approvals are completed before messages are dispatched to passengers;</li>
                <li style={{ marginBottom: 8 }}>configuring all message templates, brand guidelines, prompt overrides, escalation thresholds, and eligibility rules via the Admin Dashboard;</li>
                <li style={{ marginBottom: 8 }}>the accuracy, completeness, and integrity of all Passenger Data, airline API connections, CDP data, and third-party inputs supplied to the Offering;</li>
                <li style={{ marginBottom: 8 }}>testing the Offering's behaviour in a non-production environment before go-live;</li>
                <li style={{ marginBottom: 8 }}>ensuring that its use of the Offering complies with all aviation regulations, consumer protection laws, data protection obligations, and messaging regulations applicable to Customer's operations and the jurisdictions in which it operates; and</li>
                <li>all decisions made or approved by its personnel through the HITL process.</li>
              </ul>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
                Publisher has no liability for outcomes arising from Customer's configuration decisions, threshold settings, HITL approvals, or inaccurate inputs. Publisher's warranty obligations under Section 7.1.3 are limited to the Offering's messaging and decisioning logic failing to perform in accordance with the functionality described in the Documentation. Publisher's exclusion of liability for AI Outputs under Section 9.3 applies regardless of whether the HITL workflow was enabled, modified, or bypassed by Customer. Publisher's SLA obligations and warranty under Section 7.1.3 are suspended to the extent that Offering performance is degraded by changes to, unavailability of, or incompatibility in Customer's airline APIs, CDP, or third-party data sources.
              </p>

              <h3 style={{ fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 700, marginTop: 24, marginBottom: 12 }}>1.9. AI Model Training</h3>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
                Publisher may use anonymised, aggregated, non-personally-identifiable operational metrics (such as system performance indicators and interaction pattern statistics) derived from Customer's use of the Offering to improve the Offering's underlying AI models. For the avoidance of doubt, "operational metrics" means system-level data that has been stripped of all identifiers and cannot be reverse-engineered to identify any individual, airline, or transaction; it does not include Customer configuration data, Airline Customisations, or Passenger Data. Publisher will not use Passenger Data, Airline Customisations, or any other Customer Data to train any AI or machine learning model without Customer's express prior written consent. Section 2.4.3 governs the prohibition on using Passenger Data for model training.
              </p>

              <h3 style={{ fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 700, marginTop: 24, marginBottom: 12 }}>1.10. Airline Customisations</h3>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
                Message templates, brand guidelines, prompt overrides, and business policies configured by Customer through the Admin Dashboard ("Airline Customisations") remain the intellectual property of Customer. Publisher acquires no rights in Airline Customisations other than the limited licence to process them as necessary to provide the Offering. Publisher will treat all Airline Customisations as Confidential Information.
              </p>

              <h3 style={{ fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 700, marginTop: 24, marginBottom: 12 }}>1.11. Ownership of AI-Generated Outputs</h3>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
                All passenger-facing messages and communications generated by the Offering in response to Customer's instructions, Airline Customisations, and Passenger Data ("AI Outputs") shall be owned by Customer upon generation. Publisher makes no claim to ownership of AI Outputs. Publisher does not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or regulatory compliance of any AI Output, as set out in Section 7.2. Customer is solely responsible for any disclosure, labelling, or transparency obligations applicable to AI Outputs under applicable law, including the EU Artificial Intelligence Act and equivalent national legislation.
              </p>

              <h3 style={{ fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 700, marginTop: 24, marginBottom: 12 }}>1.12. No Free Trial</h3>

              </p>

              <h3 style={{ fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 700, marginTop: 24, marginBottom: 12 }}>1.13. Documentation Maintenance</h3>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
                Publisher will maintain Documentation that accurately describes the Offering's material functionality. Publisher will not materially reduce the functionality described in the Documentation without providing Customer at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice. Customer's right to terminate for cause under Section 11.3 applies if any such reduction constitutes a material breach of Section 7.1.3.
              </p>

              <h3 style={{ fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 700, marginTop: 24, marginBottom: 12 }}>1.14. Insurance</h3>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
                Publisher will maintain throughout the term of this Agreement: (a) professional indemnity / errors and omissions insurance with a minimum coverage of USD 1,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate; (b) cyber liability and data breach insurance with a minimum coverage of USD 1,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate; and (c) general commercial liability insurance with a minimum coverage of USD 2,000,000 per occurrence. Publisher will provide Customer with a certificate of insurance evidencing such coverage within ten (10) Business Days of a written request. Publisher will notify Customer promptly if any such policy lapses or is materially reduced.
              </p>

                To the extent applicable, the parties will abide by the requirements of European Economic Area and Swiss data protection law regarding the collection, use, transfer, retention, and other processing of Personal Data from the European Economic Area and Switzerland. All transfers of Passenger Data or Customer Data out of the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland will be governed by the Standard Contractual Clauses as set out in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021, Module 2 (Controller to Processor), made available by Publisher at the applicable URL or as otherwise communicated to Customer.

              <p style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>
                Publisher's uptime commitment, maintenance windows, and service credit entitlements are set out in Annexure A (Service Level Agreement), which is incorporated into this Agreement by reference. Publisher commits to a Monthly Uptime Percentage of 97.5%, excluding downtime attributable to: (a) scheduled maintenance windows notified in advance; (b) failures of Microsoft Azure or other third-party infrastructure outside Publisher's reasonable control; or (c) Customer's acts or omissions. In the event of any inconsistency between Annexure A and the body of this Agreement, the body of this Agreement prevails. Service credits are Customer's sole and exclusive remedy for SLA failures. Nothing in this Section limits any right Customer may have to terminate this Agreement for cause under Section 11.3. Publisher will give Customer prior written notice before deploying material software updates to the Offering. Updates to Admin Dashboard content (templates, brand guidelines, prompt overrides) are Customer-controlled and are not subject to update notifications. Version upgrades and Admin Dashboard access are included under the base Subscription.

              <p style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>
                Neither party will be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement to the extent that such failure or delay is caused by circumstances beyond that party's reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, pandemic or epidemic, acts of government, war, terrorism, civil unrest, industrial action, power or telecommunications failures, or failures of third-party infrastructure providers (including Microsoft Azure) ("Force Majeure Event"). The affected party will: (a) promptly notify the other party upon becoming aware of the Force Majeure Event; (b) use reasonable endeavours to mitigate the effects of and overcome the Force Majeure Event; and (c) resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable. For the avoidance of doubt, a Force Majeure Event affecting the aviation industry (such as severe weather, airspace closure, or air traffic control failure) that simultaneously causes both the disruption events to which the Offering responds and the unavailability of the Offering itself will excuse Publisher's performance under the SLA to the extent the unavailability is directly attributable to that Force Majeure Event. Publisher's SLA exclusions in Section 4 apply concurrently with this Section. If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than thirty (30) consecutive days, either party may terminate this Agreement on written notice without further liability, other than for obligations accrued prior to the Force Majeure Event.

                Publisher may monitor Customer's use of the Offering through the Offering's built-in usage and access logs to verify compliance with the terms of this Agreement. If Publisher determines that Customer is using the Offering outside the scope of its Subscription, Publisher will notify Customer and Customer must promptly remedy the non-compliance, including by purchasing the appropriate Subscription tier if required. All information obtained through compliance monitoring is Confidential Information and may only be used for the purpose of verifying compliance. Upon reasonable request, Publisher will make available to Customer all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with GDPR obligations for the processing of Personal Data, including through a security questionnaire or self-attestation process.

                9.1. Aggregate Cap. Each party's total aggregate liability to the other under or in connection with this Agreement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, is limited to the total Subscription fees paid by Customer in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

              <p style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>
                9.2. Data Breach Cap. Notwithstanding Section 9.1, in the event of unauthorised access, use, or disclosure of Passenger Data or Customer Data due to a breach of Publisher's obligations under Section 2.5 (Security), Publisher's maximum aggregate liability will not exceed the greater of: (a) two times (2x) the Subscription fees paid by Customer in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the incident; or (b) USD 500,000.

                9.3. AI Output Reliance. Without prejudice to Section 9.1, Publisher has no liability for any loss, cost, damage, or regulatory penalty arising from any AI Output generated by the Offering, including messaging errors, incorrect rebooking offers, or inaccurate compensation eligibility determinations, regardless of whether the HITL workflow was enabled, modified, or bypassed by Customer. This exclusion does not apply, and Publisher's liability shall instead be assessed under Section 9.1, where the Offering can be shown to have generated an output that materially deviates from the functionality described in the Documentation as a direct result of Publisher's own material breach of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.3 is not overridden by the gross negligence or fraud exception in Section 9.5.4 except where Publisher's gross negligence or fraud directly caused the AI Output defect.

              <p style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>
                9.4. Exclusion of Consequential Loss. Neither party is liable for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential loss or damage, including loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of data, business interruption, or reputational damage, arising under or in connection with this Agreement, regardless of the cause of action or the theory of liability, even if that party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

              <p style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>
                All commercial terms, including Subscription fees, any volume or usage-based components, and payment schedules are individually negotiated and set out in the applicable Order. No binding pricing commitment exists until an Order has been executed by both parties. Prospective customers must contact Publisher's sales team to obtain a quotation. Publisher reserves the right to decline to contract with any prospective customer at its sole discretion.
              </p>

              <h3 style={{ fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 700, marginTop: 24, marginBottom: 12 }}>10.2. One-Time Setup Fee</h3>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>
                In addition to the recurring Subscription fees, Customer will pay a one-time, non-refundable setup fee in the amount set out in the applicable Order ("Setup Fee"). The Setup Fee covers onboarding, initial configuration, integration with Customer's airline APIs and CDP, and go-live support as described in the Order. The Setup Fee is due and payable within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date, or as otherwise specified in the Order, and is payable regardless of whether Customer completes onboarding or activates the Offering. The Setup Fee is non-refundable in all circumstances, including on termination of this Agreement by either party.

                Subscription fees are invoiced in advance for each Subscription Year, or in accordance with the billing cadence set out in the Order. All invoices are due and payable within thirty (30) days of the invoice date unless a different payment period is specified in the Order.
              </p>

              <h3 style={{ fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 700, marginTop: 24, marginBottom: 12 }}>10.4. Late Payment</h3>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>
                Amounts not paid by the due date will accrue interest from the due date at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is lower), compounding monthly. Publisher may, on fourteen (14) days' prior written notice, suspend Customer's access to the Offering if any invoice remains unpaid for more than thirty (30) days past its due date. Suspension under this Section does not relieve Customer of its obligation to pay outstanding amounts or constitute a waiver of any of Publisher's rights.

                All fees set out in an Order are exclusive of applicable taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments, including goods and services tax (GST), value added tax (VAT), and withholding taxes ("Taxes"). Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases under this Agreement, excluding taxes based on Publisher's net income. Where Publisher is required by law to collect Taxes, Publisher will invoice Customer for those Taxes and Customer will pay them in addition to the fees. If Customer is required by law to withhold any Taxes from payments to Publisher, Customer will gross up the payment so that Publisher receives the full invoiced amount after withholding.
              </p>

              <h3 style={{ fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 700, marginTop: 24, marginBottom: 12 }}>10.6. Disputed Invoices</h3>

Interest will not accrue on amounts subject to a bona fide dispute raised in accordance with this Section during the period of active dispute resolution. Disputes not notified within fifteen (15) days of receipt of invoice are deemed accepted.
